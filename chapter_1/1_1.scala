    Side effects (examples):
      - Modifying a variable
      - Modifying a data structure in place
      - Setting a field on an object
      - Throwing an exception or halting with an error
      - Printing to the console or reading user input
      - Reading from or writing to a file
      - Drawing on the screen

    And aren’t there other useful programs that necessitate side effects or mutation?

    How do we write such programs? As we work through this book, we’ll discover how
    many programs that seem to necessitate side effects have some functional analogue.

    In other cases, we’ll find ways to structure code so that effects occur but aren’t
    observable. (For example, we can mutate data that’s declared locally in the body of
    some function if we ensure it can’t be referenced outside that function, or we can
    write to a file as long as no enclosing function can observe this occurring.)
